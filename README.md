# DT and Random Forest
In this project with the help of publicly available data from LendingClub.com and by using the lending data from 2007-2010 
we will try to classify and predict whether or not a borrower has paid back the loan in full.

Also becuase of some limitaions to Decision Tree we will be using Random Forest and compare
the results from both of them.
