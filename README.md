# DT and Random Forest
In this project we'll be using the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 
So by using the lending data from 2007-2010 we will try to classify and predict whether or not a borrower has paid back the loan in full.

Also becuase of some limitations to Decision Tree, we will be using Random Forest and compare
the results from both of them.
